# NYCitiBike
# The New York CitiBike dataset contains data related to bike-sharing trips in New York City. This data is typically used for analysis of transportation patterns, user demographics, and bike usage over time.
## I distributed the data for year 2022 in three quarters as Bike_Q1, Bike_Q2 & Bike_Q3 respectively. The code I wrote is designed to read and combine CSV files from multiple subfolders within a specified directory. It first verifies that the main directory exists and lists its contents. It then iterates through each subfolder, checking if it's a directory and identifying CSV files within it. Each CSV file is read into a DataFrame and appended to a list. After collecting all DataFrames, the code concatenates them into a single DataFrame and displays a preview of the combined data. This approach efficiently consolidates data from multiple sources into one comprehensive dataset.
